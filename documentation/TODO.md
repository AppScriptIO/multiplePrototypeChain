- Make repository contain modules related to delegation. Call it "handlePrototypeDelegation"
- ~Change repository name to "multiplePrototypeChainDelegation" as opposed to using 'inheritance' term.~
- Consider splitting the implementation of `dynamicDelegation` into its own repository, and leave `multipleDelegation` separate.
